As I mentioned in my intro, I was in an auto accident about a year ago.  I sustained injuries that have caused me pain and discomfort not only in my personal life but also professionally . As a manager of a restaurant, I spend on average 55 hours per week on my feet supporting/ performing every job function in the building.  After a year of minimal progress with physical therapy and surgical procedures I came to the realization that my life has been altered and I needed to adjust.  I am naturally logical and have a creative side that I wanted to use in my next career so I started researching my options.  Aware of my "new normal" I knew I was looking at more office type work where the sitting time was greater than the time spent on my feet but income was greater than minimum wage.  I have a family to support and 4 kids can get expensive so I also knew I needed to make a comparable salary.  After doing my due dilegence, I finally decided that the tech field was growing at a great pace and so it was where I wanted to be.
