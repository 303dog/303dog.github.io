I have chosen computer programming after weighing.... most of my options.  As a member of the Xennial generation, I remember the introduction of the internet. I remember getting the AOL and Netscape CDs in the mail offering 4 free hours of internet time via a 56k connection with subscription. I remember when the digits 911 where placed after a phone number on my pager, it meant I need to find a payphone ASAP! More importantly I remember DOS and loading up the desktop to play the space invaders type game at my neighbors house when his older brother wasn't home hogging the screen time. I was there like all the other people in my Xennial generation when all the modern conviences we take for granted today, seemed like alien technology and magic!

I like the creative aspect of coding. The satisfaction of working on a project and successfully putting it together and watching it do what it was meant to do is very filling.  Over the last decade or so I have had and contiue to have a passion for working with my hands and creating unique and functional furniture thru woodworking and I am using that passion of designing, creating and completing projects to drive my new found interest in programming.  

After working in the hospitality industry for over 25 years, I was drawn to software development because of the almost endless possibilities and applications I feel like this is an industry still in its early onset but well established and has proven its neccessity to society.  My hope is to contribute and offer more to our lives thru technology.
