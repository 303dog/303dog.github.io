I can honestly say I am very excited to be joing an industry with such a reach and ability to help people. 

After spending many years in the restaurant industry and feeling like there had to be something more out there for me, in March 2020, I found myself in a rare situtation of having the chance to do something about it, make the necessary moves and change careers!   

I have always been interested in the fact that an idea has the strength to change the world and like most I wanted to be involved in those moments. I want to help nutrure and develop those ideas and/ or at the very least I want to be a part of making those ideas become a reality.  I am sure that like most people who ponder the "why's" in daily life, the dream is real.  The opportunity is there. But timing usually is off for some reason or another. 

Deciding to enroll and complete the Software Engineer program at Flatiron was a pretty easy decision one for me as I knew it would help open doors to an industry I desperatly want to be a part of. I didn't know anything about coding, frameworks or even the different languages except that there is a ton of information to absorb and the indusrty is growing so fast that I would be commiting to a lifetime of education. 

While at work I would watch as the tables filled with the business crowd every weekday starting at 11:30am.  As I would do my rounds I would see if I could get a look at the work badges they had clipped to thier jackets or shirts. I was always interested where they worked and what they did there. Some more than others and always with an eye on new and established tech companies in the area. I guess it could be argued that I was daydreaming at work but really I was just doing recon for my dream job.  

If you look at the achievements over the years like cell phones and personal computers, it is hard to believe there was a time when payphones were everywhere. When you sat next to phone, waiting for an important call or even gaurded it because the line needed to be clear so you didn't miss it.  A trip to the library to use the computer or use the printer. These used to be chores. It used to be a lot of work to print a resume where as now you can probably do it from your phone! 

People used to only dream of being on tv for all to see and know we have technologies that make that possible for anyone who has a smart phone and a social media account. It is no surprise that the world has shrunk and the reason for that is all the amazing technology that has been created.  

Who wouldn't want to be a part of that!?  It is my hope that someday I find myself in a position where I get the opportunity to contribute to this movement. My goal is to find a need and give back in a positive way.
