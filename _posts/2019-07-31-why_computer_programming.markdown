I can honestly say I am very excited to be joining an industry with such a reach and ability to help people. 

After spending many years in the restaurant industry and feeling like there had to be something more out there for me, I recently found myself in a rare situation of having the chance to do something about it, make the necessary moves and change careers!   

I have always been interested in the fact that an idea has the strength to change the world and like many, I want to be involved in those moments that create those ideas. I want to help nurture and develop those ideas and/or at the very least I want to be a part of making those ideas become a reality.  I am sure that like most people who ponder the "why's" in daily life, the dream is real. The opportunity is there. But timing usually is off for some reason or another. 

Deciding to enroll and complete the Software Engineering program at Flatiron was a pretty easy decision for me as I knew it would help open doors to an industry I desperately want to be a part of.  I didn't know anything about coding, frameworks or even the different languages except that there is a ton of information to absorb and the industry is growing so fast that I would be committing to a lifetime of education. 

While at work I would watch as the tables filled with the business crowd every weekday starting at 11:30am.  As I would do my rounds I would see if I could get a look at the work badges they had clipped to their jackets or shirts. I was always interested where they worked and what they did there. Some I was interested in more than others and I always had an eye on tech companies in the area. I guess it could be argued that I was daydreaming at work, the truth is that I was doing recon for my dream job.  

In one way or another technology helps even the most remote parts of the world. It has been able to reach in ways not before possible.  Whether it is facilitating water distribution to a remote area or making it possible for the deaf to hear or even letting you post that silly dance online for all to see, the way technology touches our lives is priceless. 

Who wouldn't want to be a part of that!?  It is my hope that someday I find myself in a position where I get the opportunity to contribute to all the this greatness!
