I decided to clear up a little confusion about these two concepts. Hopefully this quick snip helps make it clear! 

A useful mechanism when your code needs to be repeated. Looping in the code can be designed to cycle until specific conditions are met by using a loop call such as *.each* ,*loop* or *.times*.  Though similiar to conditional statements the two are not the same.

A conditional statement typically uses an "if" statement and runs until the "if" becomes true. So a conditional statement ususally only runs once because of the "conditional" component of the code. If the user is logged in do this..... if not do that...

A loop runs until it is false. So the code may read as "if" the number is positive continue rendering the number and not until it finds a negative number will it stop.  I nkow it sounds very similair but it is a destinct difference and notha re very useful in programming algorithms.
