I created a program using Ruby, open-uri and Nokogiri to walk the user through the top 100 movies of all time.  This was a class project that let us combine all the skills we had been learning and put them to work together as a final project.   

I have to admit it was fun learning how everything works together but in reality, I dont feel like I learned more than a tiny fraction of what is possible.  Having said that I was able to write this program and it felt good.

Focusing on the seperation of concerns was probably my most challenging task.  As I am new to coding, when I start to write I find it easiest to begin and end all in the same class but that is not the proper way. This assignment was designed to test your knoweldge of object orientation, structure and understanding the basics of Ruby.  

From the moment the user begins the program the input is taken in and the code provides multiple choice menus while at the same time invoking Nokogiri to scrape the data from the IMBd website and collecting the data into an array of hashes where it will be quicker to access while the user is using the program. The first point where the user is asked to make a choice off 1, 2 or 3 with each seperatly listing specific movies depnding on the users choice.  Next, the user chooses the movie they want more details on and the code finds the requested information from the class instance @@all where the data has been stored.  

I dont want to give the wrong impression, I struggled a lot with bringing this all together. Long hours and many days were spent tweeking and polishing. Several times I found myself second guessing my choice to learn programming. I often thought "what am i doing, I am 42 years old with no tech experience."  but I have good support and I chose a solid school with resources and people that are available and williing when I need them so I cant use that as an excuse. In the end, though the project was not 100% on point, I am giving myself a break because, well for my mental state, I need too..  lol
