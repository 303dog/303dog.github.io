Here I will discuss the process of creating an application using the CRUD and MVC processes through Sinatra.  Sinatra is a nice tool that helps set up your repo with most of the goodies you will need to structure your idea into a working application.  

I used active record to organize and manage all the data the user will be entering from the terminal and the CRUD process to make managing that data a bit easier. The process of diving up tasks is given to a process called MVC or Model/View/Controller. This is a divide and conquer technique that prioritizes tasks making it easier to write code and easier to understand code that someone else has written.

The idea seems simple enough and setting this up went pretty smooth.  I found this project to be challenging at times and also rewarding.
