After taking some time to explore what exactly coding is and discovering some of the different programming languages available, I was formally introduced to JavaScript and I am not disappointed!  I feel this was a very general introduction so I cannot talk too much about the depth and complexity but I do understand that JavaScript has many applications and advantages when compared to other languages.

Back in the 90's, the world was looking for a way to manipulate the DOM and create a more dynamic way of interacting with the internet.  The thought was that users could be more engaged, more entertained by the webpages they were looking at and ultimately feel a fluid user experience witout all the page refreshing and loading time lapses.  Personally, I remember a time that I was hesitant on clicking buttons or links on a web page. Not because of possible security breaches or scams but because of the time it would take.  I often would think to myself "is it necessary?" to my purpose or can I keep at what I am doing and accomplish the result I want?

With JavaScript it is possible to manipulate the DOM. This means that it is now possible to update and/or change the webpage without reloading the page.  A user can click on a picture and render a slideshow without having to reload the page from the website.  It is even possible to have multiple menus and form options that a user can interact with in a more timely manner.

JavaScript uses EventListeners to "listen" to the page for movements or clicks from the user. These EventListeners are programmed to specific movements or clicks such as a "submit" button or hovering the mouse curser over an image.  When these events happen, it triggers the EventListener to perform a designated function for that perticular event.  Having this EventListener feature provides a lot of functionality and allows the user a more indepth experience when interacting with the page.
