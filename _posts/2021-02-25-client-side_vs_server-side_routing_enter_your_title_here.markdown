The content of your blog post goes here.
 want to take a moment to discuss client-side routing and server-side routing and give a clear picture of the differences. I will start with the client-side and move into server-side routing concept and then I will talk about the differences

Any website or application that you can access from your computer or phone is going to be enabled on a server… somewhere.

When you think about routing it is best to not over complicate things. Routing is the act of directing an application or website in the desired direction by changing the URL. The separation between client-side and server-side happens depending on the desired outcome.

 When a route is changed on the client-side, the request is handled by the frontend programming usually by a link or a click of a button and the route is never sent to the server, but instead the program changes its state and manipulates the DOM accordingly.  New button may appear or details about the picture you clicked on my display; this is going to be the client-side routing at work.
 
It might be easier to think about this like you are a competing chef on a TV cooking challenge show. For the “client-side” challenge you are given a 4 course menu. Now you get only one trip to the store to gather your ingredients so you get your buggy and list and start checking off items until you have everything you need for this grand meal!  Once back in the kitchen (DOM), you can start to render your recipes. Unfortunately, you do not know if your customer is even that hungry, they may only want the first course and so you could be stuck with a lot of wasted or unneeded items. This method will obviously take a little bit of time since you are trying to gather everything at once but the execution of the recipes (program) will typically happen quickly and the meals will go out smoothly without those big gaps in between courses that cause you to wonder if your order got lost.

For the “server-side” challenge you are given a 4 course menu BUT this time you are not allowed a buggy so you find yourself carrying only the needed items for the first dish back to the kitchen. When you are back in the kitchen and the recipe is executed and plated, you can now go back to the store and gather the needed items for the next course if your customer orders it… and so on and so on until all 4 courses have been served or until the customer leaves. Without question this will take a bit longer than the first challenge since there are so many more possible trips to the store that need to be had.

Both ways are addressing the URL or change of the URL.  Client-side is able to differentiate a route that needs to be sent to the server for more data or knows that it has everything it needs in house with the help of an installed routing library.

Client-side routing offers a quicker end product but has its drawbacks as it can be less “personalized” and offer unwanted or unneeded information. But with all the ingredients now on-hand, if the customer does want something else it should be rather speedy to put together and present since the chef really doesn’t need to go all the way to the store again.

Where-as server-side routing is more request-orientated, meaning you can be specific about what you would like before it goes out and gathers it for you. It can be more customized and because of that, it is generally more time consuming.  This way if you want a salad but hate croutons and are allergic to tomatoes, you can have just that without the waste.
