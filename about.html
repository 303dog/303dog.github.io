<p>After 25 years of working in restaurants and hospitality , a career move into coding is not only a huge change but also challenging and exciting!  I have a genuine curiosity  of how things work and find programming to be not only interesting and satisfying but fun too!   I enjoy team based projects as well as solo tasks and I appreciate constructive feedback as I know there is a lot to learn.</p>
